# rvc
random video clip generator

I had a friend ask if I could make an app that would generate a random X second long video clip from
a provided video. I thought this would be a great opportunity to learn macOS/SwiftUI and decided to
take it on.

## To Install
Just go to the release tab and download the RVC.zip file. Then,  you'll probably have to
shift-click/right-click on it and open from there.. since your mac isn't going to trust me because I
haven't signed it.
